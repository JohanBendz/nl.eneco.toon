Let Homey control your Toon!

Set the target temperature, read the room temperature and display your electricity usage in Insights!

NOTE: Currently the Toon API poses some limitations, gas measurement events are not pushed to Homey and only one Toon can be installed on a Homey at a time. We are waiting for these features to be implemented by Toon API.

DISCLAIMER: This application uses the Toon API but has not been developed, certified or otherwise approved on behalf of or on the instructions of Toon.
